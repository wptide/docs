# API

The API implements MySQL, PHP-FPM, and an Nginx web server with WordPress installed 
serving a theme and a REST API.

The local database is stored in the `data/api/mysql` directory. If you ever need 
to start from scratch delete that directory and run `make api.setup` again. Be 
sure to stop the API with `make api.down` or `make down` and then start it again 
with `make api.up`.
