Documentation for [wptide.org](http://wptide.org).

This repo uses a modified version of [Docpres](https://github.com/docpress/docpress) to allow integrating with WordPress. It's a very basic WordPress theme that resolves all routes into the main `index.php` file where they pull the static content generated by Docpress.

## Installation

To develop locally, run:
1. `git clone` to clone this repo to WordPress theme folder.
2. `npm install` to install the repo's dependencies.
3. `npm run link` to link the local docpress packages and install their dependencies.
4. `npm run dev` to build and watch assets or `npm run build` to just build the assets.
5. Activate the theme and visit the homepage.

## Development Notes

* `docpress` customized Docpress generator that we bundle with the theme
* `docs` is the root of the content source
* `src` contains all styles, scripts and layout
* `_docpress` is the build folder, never place anything here as it will get overwritten
